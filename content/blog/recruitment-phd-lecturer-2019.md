Our research group has 2 open positions: One PhD position and one Lecturer position. Deadline for both applications is <b>2019-08-12</b>.

# PhD Position

Our group is participating in the HASTE project ([Hierarchical Analysis of Temporal and Spatial Image Data](https://pharmb.io/project/haste/)) and we are now seeking a PhD Student to join our team, with placement in the research group of Assoc. Prof. Ola Spjuth. Co-supervisors will be Prof. Carolina WÃ¤hlby and Assoc. Prof. Andreas Hellander.

The HASTE project is funded by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF) and aims at developing new, intelligent ways of processing and managing very large amounts of microscopy images in order to be able to leverage the imminent explosion of image data from modern experimental setups in the biosciences. Industry collaborators are Vironova AB and AstraZeneca AB.

This PhD project has a focus on machine-learning with quantifiable confidence or probability, and in particular working with and applying Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI), Online Compression Modeling and Probabilistic (Venn) Predictions on image data from the collaborating industrial partners AstraZeneca and Vironova. Have a look at the [HASTE publications](http://haste.research.it.uu.se/publications/) for the published work so far by our team.
