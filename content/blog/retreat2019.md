On August 27-28, our research group was on a retreat to [Krusenberg Mansion](https://krusenbergherrgard.se), where we had good presentations and discussed planning and strategies on research and education activities in the group. In the evening the social program involved Sauna and a nice dinner at the mansion. We had very good weather, as you can see from the photos below!
