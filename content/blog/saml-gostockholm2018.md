[Samuel Lampa](https://pharmb.io/people/saml/) presented on the [Go Stockholm 2018 conference](https://eventbrite.com/e/go-stockholm-conference-tickets-49325007425),
on the topic of "[Using Flow-based programming to write tools and workflows for Scientific Computing in Go](https://pharmb.io/presentation/2018-flowbased-for-science-in-golang/)".

The talk described first some findings from our research on how [Flow-based
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) can be used
in Go almost without frameworks, and ending with mentioning libraries
developed in the group based on these principles: 

- [FlowBase](/tool/flowbase/) - Flow-based programming unframework)
- [rdf2smw](https://github.com/rdfio/rdf2smw) - Data conversion tool developed with FlowBase
- [SciPipe](/tool/scipipe/) - Workflow library developed with Flow-based programming principles

## Description of the event

[Go Stockholm conference 2018](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/go-stockholm-conference-tickets-49325007425#) is the first full-day conference organized by the
[Go Stockholm meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Go-Stockholm), which has recently grown to over 700 members, and
was hosted at Google Stockholm in their new Meetup space.

The conference featured a number of data science related talks, with one session
wholly dedicated to data science.

**Keywords:** Flow-based programming, Go, Golang, Scientific Workflows, Bioinformatics, Distributed Computing

**Takeaways:** How scientific software development can be made more flexible, robust and maintainable, by building on the component-oriented principles of Flow-based programming.
