5 people of our group visited the conference: **Phenotypic Screening, High-Content Analysis and AI: Overcoming the Challenges** that was held March 2-3rd at AstraZeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden.

Ola Spjuth shared the session ***AI and Machine Learning*** where also Phil Harrison had an oral presentation: <i>Deep learning models for RNA- based drug delivery using time-lapse microscopy image data.</i>

We were all very excited as Jonne Rietdijk won the ***best poster award*** for 10,000 SEK! Congrats Jonne! Phil also received a prize, although a slightly smaller one.
