Our recent grant application **Multi-level profiling of Coronavirus-infected cells by combining Viral Entry Assays, Cell Painting, and DrugSEQ** was awarded 500 KSEK by SciLifeLab and Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse in a joint effort with others to tackle COVID-19.

Our team thereby joins the research area [SciLifeLab Drug discovery and repurposing of drugs](https://www.scilifelab.se/scilifelab-efforts-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/the-scilifelab-national-covid-19-research-program/drug-discovery-and-repurposing-of-drugs/
).

Our group leads a project to profile corona-infected cells using our Cell Painting methodology, and combine cell morphology data with RNAseq data from the [Nelander lab](https://nelanderlab.org/) using their DrugSEQ methodology. The experiments on coronavirus will be made in the [Helleday lab](http://helleday.org/) at Karolinska Institutet. The drug compounds we will expose the cells to come from [Chemical Biology Consortium Sweden (CBCS)](http://www.cbcs.se/). We are very much looking forward to this new project and collaboration!


## Virtual Screening towards COVID-19 ##

Together with company [Prosilico](http://prosilico.com/), our team is also contributing with predictive ADME models and expertise to an Open Source virtual screening effort based on the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease as solved by [Diamond](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/covid-19/for-scientists/Main-protease-structure-and-XChem.html). All code and predictions are available openly on https://github.com/tdudgeon/jupyter_mpro.
