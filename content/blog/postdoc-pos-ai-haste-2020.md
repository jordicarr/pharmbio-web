We are currently looking for an ambitious, highly motivated Postdoc with a good background in AI and imaging to join our research group where we have built up a robotized cell profiling system with high-content microscopy imaging as primary readout. The successful candidate will join an interdisciplinary team of researchers and participate in a project aiming to develop autonomous laboratories with applications in systems pharmacology and systems toxicology. For more information on the group, see https://pharmb.io and the automation project: https://pharmb.io/project/ai-automated-laboratory/.


This is a 2-year postdoc position. Assignments include development and application of methods for large-scale analysis of microscopy images using AI / Machine Learning within the framework of the [HASTE project](http://haste.research.it.uu.se). The project focuses on AI / machine learning with quantifiable confidence or probability, based on methods such as Active Learning, Conformal Prediction, Probabilistic (Venn) Prediction, and Deep Learning. Applicants are expected to collaborate with other project members and participate in regular research visits with industry partners AstraZeneca and Vironova.


## Qualifications
PhD degree or a foreign degree equivalent to a PhD degree in a relevant field. The PhD degree must have been obtained no more than three years prior to the application deadline. The three year period can be extended due to circumstances such as sick leave, parental leave, duties in labour unions, etc. Documented experience with AI / ML methods and / or computerized image analysis. Experience in programming in eg Python is a requirement. Applicants should have excellent communication skills and be keen to actively interact with other team members including biologists, systems developers and researchers in AI / ML. Furthermore, applicants should be curious and creative, take initiatives and build relationships. Applicants should have good organizational ability, be able to structure work with multiple projects and solve anticipated and unexpected problems. The applicant must be able to express themselves very well in written and oral English
