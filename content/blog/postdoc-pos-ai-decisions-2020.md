We are currently looking for an ambitious, highly motivated Postdoc with a good background in AI and an interest in automation with robotics in the field of life science, to join the research group of Assoc. Prof. Ola Spjuth (group website:https://www.farmbio.uu.se/research/pharmaceutical-bioinformatics/ ). The group has built up a robotized cell profiling system with high-content microscopy imaging as primary readout, and the purpose of the project is to train models on this data and develop methods for intelligent decision making when designing future experiments. Theory and methods development will have an initial focus on confidence predictors, probabilistic predictors and active learning, and the methods will be implemented and evaluated in the robotized lab. The successful candidate will join an interdisciplinary team of researchers and participate in a project aiming to develop autonomous laboratories with applications in pharmacology and toxicology. For more information on the project, see https://pharmb.io/project/ai-automated-laboratory/.

This is a 2 year postdoc position and part of the strategic research area effort [eSSENCEÂ´s PostDoc-program towards new e-science methods and tools for artificial intelligence in research](https://essenceofescience.se/seven-postdoc-positions-at-uppsala-university-within-the-essence-initiative/).

## Qualifications
The highly motivated candidate should have a PhD in a relevant field, and documented previous experience of AI/ML methods. Skills in programming/scripting with e.g. Python is a requirement. Experience from working in life science and/or with robotics/automation is desirable. The candidate should have excellent communication skills and be keen on actively interacting with other team members including biologists, software engineers, and researchers in AI/ML. Excellent skills in oral and written English are required.
