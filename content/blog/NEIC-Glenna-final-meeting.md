The [NeIC](http://neic.no/) project Glenna (https://neic.no/glenna/) had its final meeting in Uppsala on March 10, 2020. Our group's involvement has been in the project towards establishing a Nordic AI collaboration, and in particular on: 

1) Evaluating KubeFlow for portable AI models (Oliver Stein).

2) Joining GPU nodes from CSC into SSC for AI modeling using Kubernetes and OpenShift (Anders Larsson).

3) Developing the [Lean AI Stack](https://github.com/leanaiorg/leanaistack) open source project (Morgan Ekmefjord).


In addition to a program reporting what has been achieved, there was also a visit to our lab.
