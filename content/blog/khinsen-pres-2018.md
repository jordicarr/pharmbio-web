## Abstract

To err is human. Scientists being human, they make mistakes. Since the
beginning of organized scientific research, this fact of life has been taken
into account by the introduction of verification and validation protocols.
Computer-aided research has introduced new sources of mistakes that are so far
insufficiently covered by these protocols: bugs in software, operator errors,
and inappropriate use of scientific methods encoded in software. I will review
the progress that has been made recently towards more trustworthy results,
notably through reproducibility, and present a first approach to the next
step: verifiable computational science.

The presentation will be 30 minutes followed by 30 minutes discussions.

Host:  Ola Spjuth (ola.spjuth@farmbio.uu.se)

## About the speaker

[Dr. Konrad Hinsen](http://khinsen.net/), is a
researcher at the [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/) (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique),
working at the [Centre de Biophysique
Moléculaire](http://cbm.cnrs-orleans.fr/) in Orléans and as an associate
researcher at the [Synchrotron SOLEIL](http://www.synchrotron-soleil.fr/).

Dr. Hinsen's primary research interests are the structure and dynamics of
proteins, using molecular simulation and statistical physics, and the
methodology of computational science, in particular concerning
reproducibility. More information is available on [Dr. Hinsen's personal
website](http://khinsen.net/).

Konrad will also serve as opponent for the PhD thesis defence of Samuel
Lampa on the topic *”[Reproducible Data Analys is in
Drug Discovery with Scientific Workflows and the Semantic
Web](/blog/dissertation-samuel/)”*, on Sept 28, at 13.00 in
room B22.
