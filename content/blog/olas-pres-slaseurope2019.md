[Ola Spjuth](https://pharmb.io/people/olas/) presented on the [SLAS Europe 2019](https://slaseurope2019.org) conference,
with the title of the presentation: "[Building an informatics solution to sustain AI-guided cell profiling with high-content microscopy imaging](https://pharmb.io/presentation/2019-building-an-informatics-solution-to-sustain-ai-guided-cell-profiling-with-high-content-microscopy-imaging/)"

## Abstract
High-content microscopy in automated laboratories present many challenges for storing and processing data, and to build AI models to aid decision making. We have established an informatics system to serve a robotized cell profiling setup with incubators, liquid handling and high-content microscopy for microplates. The informatics system consists of computational infrastructure (CPUs, GPUs, storage), middleware (Kubernetes), imaging database and software (OMERO), and workflow system (Pachyderm) to perform online prioritization of new data, and automate the process from acquired images to continuously updated and deployed AI models. The AI methodologies include Deep Learning models trained on image data, and conventional machine learning models trained on data from Cell Painting experiments. The microservice architecture makes the system scalable and expandable, and a key objective is on improving screening and toxicity assessment using AI-aided intelligent experimental design.
