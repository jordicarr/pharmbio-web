**Welcome to the Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics research group at Uppsala University**

Principal Investigator: [Ola Spjuth](https://pharmb.io/people/olas/)

#### Research focus: Intelligent systems for drug discovery and chemical safety

The Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics research group focuses on mathematical and
statistical modeling, informatics and quantitative analysis of pharmacological
systems. We develop methods, algorithms and software to study and model
pharmaceutical interactions, and a key focus in the group is how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can aid the drug discovery process; e.g.
in drug screening and when studying drug toxicity, metabolism and resistance. We combine in silico and in vitro experiments at the cellular level, and have a big focus on data analytics, informatics, and using modern e-infrastructure (such as
high-performance and cloud computing). We are involved in
several national and international consortia and have a tight connection to the
pharmaceutical industry, Uppsala University Hospital, and Science for Life
Laboratory. See the [Projects](https://pharmb.io/project/) page for more
information on our ongoing research projects.
