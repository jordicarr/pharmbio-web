**Welcome to the Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics research group at Uppsala University**

Principal Investigator: [Ola Spjuth](https://pharmb.io/people/olas/)

#### Research focus: Data-intensive and translational bioinformatics

The Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics research group focuses on mathematical and
statistical modeling, informatics and quantitative analysis of pharmacological
systems. We develop methods, algorithms and software to study and model
pharmaceutical interactions, and a key focus in the group is how predictive
modeling, large-scale calculations and modern e-infrastructure (such as
high-performance and cloud computing) can aid the drug discovery process; e.g.
when studying drug toxicity, metabolism and resistance. We are involved in
several national and international consortia and have a tight connection to the
pharmaceutical industry, Uppsala University Hospital, and Science for Life
Laboratory. See the [Projects](https://pharmb.io/project/) page for more
information on our ongoing research projects.
