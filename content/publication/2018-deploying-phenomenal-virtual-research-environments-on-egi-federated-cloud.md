abstract="The PhenoMeNal e-infrastructure supports data processing and analysis workflows for large datasets generated in metabolomics research. The computational services provided within PhenoMeNal enable researchers to build, share and run reproducible data processing workflows in cloud environments. We here describe how PhenoMeNal VREs have been successfully deployed on EGI Federated Cloud resources."
