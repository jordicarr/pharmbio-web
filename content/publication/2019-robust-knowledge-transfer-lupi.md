abstract="Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) enables the inclusion of additional (privileged) information when training machine learning models; data that is not available when making predictions. The methodology has been successfully applied to a diverse set of problems from various fields. SVM+ was the first realization of the LUPI paradigm which showed fast convergence but did not scale well. To address the scalability issue, knowledge  transfer  approaches were proposed to estimate privileged information from standard features in order to construct improved decision rules.Most available knowledge transfer methods use regression techniques and the same data for approximating the privileged features as for learning the transfer function.Inspired by the cross-validation approach, we propose to partition the training data into K folds and use each fold for learning a transfer function and the remaining folds for approximations of privileged features - we refer to this a robust knowledge transfer. We conduct empirical evaluation considering four different experimental setups using one synthetic and three real datasets. These experiments demonstrate that our approach yields improved accuracy as compared to LUPI with standard knowledge transfer."
