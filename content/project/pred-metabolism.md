This project aims at developing methods for predicting
site-of-metabolism and metabolites based on chemical structure. Using
data mining techniques we have developed the tool MetaPrint2D for
site-of-metabolism prediction. The project aims at improving these
models and also to predict putative metabolites. The work is carried out
in close collaboration with AstraZeneca R&D and models and tools are
available from the Bioclipse workbench.
