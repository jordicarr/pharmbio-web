Translational bioinformatics is defined as: ”The development of storage,
analytic, and interpretive methods to optimize the transformation of
increasingly voluminous biomedical data into proactive, predictive,
preventative, and participatory health”. Our group carries out research
focused on translating massively parallel sequencing via automated
bioinformatics analysis, informatics solutions, and reporting systems to
aid in clinical settings. Projects include long-read amplicon sequencing
of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), TP53, and multi-drug resistant
bacteria. We are also part of the joint SeRC-eSSENCE flagship project
“e-Science for Cancer Prevention and Control” (eCPC). Collaborators
include the National Genomics Institute (NGI), Uppsala Academic
Hospital, and Karolinska Institutet.
