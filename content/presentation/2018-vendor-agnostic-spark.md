abstract = "Cloud and bare-metal deployments can be challenging in many ways. When it comes to Apache Spark and other Big Data frameworks vendor lock-in solutions are available. These kind of deployments are usually proprietary and differ slightly on each vendor. In this meetup we will see how Terraform (https://www.terraform.io/) can be used to deploy immutable and vendor-agnostic Apache Spark deployments. This first session will focus on cloud providers that support the OpenStack API (https://www.openstack.org/passport), but the methodology is vendor-agnostic and can be applied to any cloud-provider and even in bare-metal settings."
